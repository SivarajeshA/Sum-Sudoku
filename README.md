# Sum-Sudoku

Consider the game of simplified (n, m) Sum-Sudoku. The game consists of an n × n
square-grid. Each entry in the grid has to be filled using digits between 1 and m
(both inclusive). The usual rules of Sudoku apply where a digit must appear only
once in each row and each column. And in this simplified version of the game, we
will ignore the “box”-constraint that Sudoku usually has. In addition, Sum-Sudoku
requires that each row and each column sum to a specified value.</br>

In this problem, I used the Z3 SMT solver’s Java API to investigate properties
of Sum-Sudoku puzzles. </br>
